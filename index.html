                Samay’s journey into the realm of AI began during the pandemic, which piqued his interest, and he subsequently secured an internship with a Silicon Valley-based AI development agency during the 10th grade. Since then, he has designed and taught his own summer course to teach teenagers AI, which he’s been running for 3+ years. He’s worked and gained experience at various companies, including building projects for unicorns such as Revel Mopeds, but his real passion is creating groundbreaking AI models on the R&D side, including state-of-the-art computer vision models for detecting distracted driving and contributing to open-source AI research like LAION.AI. His research has been published and he’s won numerous competitions, including competing at the Regeneron International Science and Engineering Fair. Samay is researching brain-computer interfaces to control modular robots as a student at Columbia University and working remotely as an R&D engineer at a health insurance startup in California.
