# Samay's Journey in AI

Samay’s journey into the realm of AI began during the pandemic, which piqued his interest, and he subsequently secured an internship with a Silicon Valley-based AI development agency during the 10th grade. Since then, he has designed and taught his own summer course to teach teenagers AI, which he’s been running for over 3 years.

He has worked and gained experience at various companies, including building projects for unicorns such as [Revel Mopeds](https://www.revelmopeds.com). However, his real passion lies in creating groundbreaking AI models on the R&D side. This includes state-of-the-art computer vision models for detecting distracted driving and contributing to open-source AI research like [LAION.AI](https://laion.ai). His research has been published, and he has won numerous competitions, including competing at the [Regeneron International Science and Engineering Fair](https://www.societyforscience.org/regeneron-international-science-and-engineering-fair/).

Currently, Samay is researching brain-computer interfaces to control modular robots as a student at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu) and working remotely as an R&D engineer at a health insurance startup in California.
